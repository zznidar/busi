## Key functionalities
> ### 1. View all buses
> If no trip is selected, all buses will display after first call of `refresh()` function. This mode can also be accessed by clicking the bus icon inside info panel menu. This is triggered by calling `showBuses()` (old `godusModus()`) function without any trips inside `trips` object.

>### 2. Add favourite bus lines
>One of key features of the app is adding custom faourite bus lines inside favourites panel of the app. Clicking a button *Dodaj relacijo* invokes a function `addBusStop()` that prompts user for entry point bus station at first, then lists all available options, then prompts for exit point bus station and lists all options. Upon completing the last selection the relation is added permanantly to the user favourites panel and saved localy. The relation can be removed by holding th button for three seconds. A click event is bound to the button, and will filter all trips to display only those that match the targeted bus line. Buses are displayed on the map, and `trips` object is updated, so from this point on the only these buses will be refreshed periodicaly. Also upon pressing the button the timetable for the relation will be generated. There the buses ranging from past hour till the end of the day are displayed, along with scheduled or actual departure time listed if available. Live buses gain a green border and special icon, so user can know that the bus can be live tracked. 

>### 3. Search bus stops
> Another way of interacting with current bus arrivals is to invoke search field by using search button in the toolbar. The search updates after at least three letters are entered. When user selects the name of the bus stop, all available options are diplayed on the map. User than has to tap on the right bus station and is transported into timetables section of the toolbar where all buses approaching thist stop in the next X time interval are displayed. Live buses gain green border and live track icon, delays are displayed if available. If clicked on the bus it tracks it on the map.

>### 4. Bus line geometry with delays
> Everytime the popup of the bus is opened, the bus line geometry (polyline) will apear if available. Markers for bus stops are also added. If user holds on the stop marker scheduled arrival on the bus will appear. If realtime info is available, predicted arrival as well as delay will be displayed as well.

>### 5. Shraing function
> If device is supported the share button will apear in the bottom left corner of the popup bubble. Pressing it will invoke a `navigator.share()` method, sharing a link with busID as such: https://zznidar.github.io/busi`?{busID}`. If this link is accessed, on the page load a `displayBus()` function will be invoked and bus popup will be opened automatically so the end user can track the bus. This is a very suitable way of sharing locations between users.
